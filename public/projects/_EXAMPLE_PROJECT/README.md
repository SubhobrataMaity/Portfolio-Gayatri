# Example Project

This is an example project folder to demonstrate the structure.

## To Create Your Own Project:

1. Create a new folder in `/public/projects/` with your project name
2. Add your images/videos (PNG, GIF, MP4, etc.)
3. Name them in order: 1.png, 2.png, 3.png, etc.

## This Example Folder

You can delete this `_EXAMPLE_PROJECT` folder once you add your own projects.

The underscore prefix (_) makes it sort first, so it appears at the top as a reference.

**Tip**: Add actual image files here to see the system in action!
